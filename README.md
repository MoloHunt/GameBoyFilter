##Usage

- Open the application and it will prompt you to select an image

- Then if the image is divisible by a predetermined scale number it will ask you if you want to either render full size, pixel for pixel or render in a lower resolution

- The program will then convert the image and display the original side by side with the new version

- Pressing 'S' at this point will allow you to save the image, this will save the file as a PNG so you need to add ".png" at the end

##To Do

- [X] Streamline Saving
- [X] Add ability to crop image if it doesn't match the scaling
- [X] Ability to input custom scale
- [ ] Convert to applet that can be embedded into a web page
