##Usage

- Open the application and it will prompt you to select an image

- The slider at the top allows you to select 0, 2 or 4 scaling, this means the image generated will either be native size, half size or quarter size when the pixels are generated

- The program will then convert the image and display the original side by side with the new version

- Pressing the *"Save Image"* button will now bring up the save dialog, but you can still press 'S' if you prefer

- There is a new *"Load Image"* button that has moved the save image button over, pressing it will prompt you for a new image and resize the window it's all kinds of magic. Note: you can also press 'L' if you want to

- There is also now a check box for *"Gray Scale"* which lets you generate the image in gray scale, but keeping the five distinct colours, just in gray
